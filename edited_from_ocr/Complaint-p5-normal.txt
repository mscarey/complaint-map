NATURE OF ACTION
I. INTRODUCTION
. No one is above the law. In the run-up to the 2016 election, Russia mounted a
brazen attack on American Democracy. The opening salvo was a cyberattack on the DNC, carried
out on American soil. In 2015 and 2016, Russian intelligence services hacked into the DNC's
computers, penetrated its phone systems, and exfiltrated tens of thousands of documents and
emails. Russia then used this stolen information to advance its own interests: destabilizing the
U.S. political environment, denigrating the Democratic presidential nominee, and supporting the
campaign of Donald J. Trump ("Trump"), whose policies would benefit the Kremlin.
2 In the Trump campaign, Russia found a willing and active partner in this effort. In
2016, individuals tied to the Kremlin notified the Trump campaign that Russia intended to interfere
with our democracy. Through multiple meetings, emails, and other communications, these
Russian agents made clear that their government supported Trump and was prepared to use stolen
emails and other information to damage his opponent and the Democratic party.

Russia Steals Massive Trove of Documents from the DNC as Trump
Associate Brags About Stolen Documents
77.
On April 18, 2016, Russia launched a second phase of its cyberattack on DNC
servers located in Virginia and Washington, D.C. This attack was executed by GRU agents and
targeted the DNC's research department, document repositories, information technology
department, and other departments. Upon information and belief, high-ranking Russian officials
ordered the GRU agents to infiltrate the DNC's servers, and the agents were obligated to carry out
that order

On April 22, 2016, the GRU staged several gigabytes of DNC data located on the
DNC's servers for unauthorized and surreptitious exfiltration-or, more commonly, theft.

Four days later, on April 26, 2016, Papadopoulos met again with Russian agent
Mifsud. At the meeting, Mifsud informed Papadopoulos that the Russians "have dirt on [Hillary
Clinton]" in the form of "thousands of emails."9 In his guilty plea, Papadopoulos attested that he
understood Mifsud had "substantial connections to high-level government officials" and "had met
with some of those officials in Moscow immediately prior to telling [Papadopoulos] about the
thousands of emails."O Rather than report such information to any authorities or halt
communications with Mifsud, Papadopoulos excitedly emailed a Trump Campaign official or
April 27, 2016: "Have some interesting messages coming in from Moscow about a trip when the
time is right." He also emailed Trump Campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski, reiterating
Russia's interest in hosting Trump. And in May 2016, Papadopoulos confided to an Australiarn
diplomat that Russia had politically damaging information on Secretary Clinton. The Australiarn
diplomat reported this to U.S. authorities.51 This exchange between Papadopoulos and the
Australian diplomat prompted the FBI to launch its counterintelligence investigation into contacts
between Russia and the Trump campaign52

1. As Trump, Jr. explained, the Trump Organization "slaw] a lot of money pouring in
from Russia," and "Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section ofour assets."11 And
Trump's son Eric Trump has reportedly stated that substantial funding for Trump's golf courses
comes from Russian investors.12
52. Manafort and Gates Ukrainian Connections: From 2004 until at least 2015,
Manafort was an advisor to the Russian-allied former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych
"Yanukovych") and his Kremlin-allied Party of Regions, as well as its successor, the Oppositiorn
Bloc.13 In 2012, Manafort allegedly helped the Ukrainian party secretly route at least $2.2 million
in payments to two prominent Washington lobbying firms. Manafort's ties to Yanukovych and
the Ukraine are so deep that his own daughter has stated that the "money we have is blood
money."5 After repeatedly denying that he had ever worked for the Ukrainian government, on
June 27, 2017, Manafort retroactively registered as a foreign agent and reported $17.1 million in
payments from Yanukovych's party between 2012 and 2014.16 Since October 27, 2017, Manafort
has been indicted on dozens of counts, including money laundering and making false statements,
related to his work for the pro-Russian government in Ukraine.!7 Additional financial records
indicate that Manafort was in debt to Putin-tied oligarch Oleg Deripaska ("Deripaska") by as much
as $17 million prior to joining the Trump Campaign.1
53. Manafort also employed Konstantin Kilimnik "Kilimnik") as his close aide.
Kilimnik is a former linguist in the Russian army who is believed to be an agent of the GRU, and
whom the FBI believes maintained ties to Russian intelligence during the 2016 U.S. presidential
campaign.19 Kilimnik was in communication with both Manafort and Gates while they were
serving in the two most senior positions in the Trump Campaign, and acted as a middleman
between them and Deripaska.20

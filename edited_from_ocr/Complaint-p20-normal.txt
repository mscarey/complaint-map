59.
Despite the obvious political risks of associating himself with a foreign despot,
Trump continued to make laudatory statements about Putin well into the presidential primary
season. He said that he would have a "great relationship with Putin",27 and that it was a "great
honor to be so nicely complimented by [Putin, who was] so highly respected within his own
country and beyond."28
60. Further, Trump's statementsas well as the pro-Russian entourage with which he
surrounded himself left ttle doubt that Trump, if elected president, would adopt policies that
favored Russia and Putin, even if those policies conflicted with longstanding U.S. foreign policy,
and the best interests of the United States. Trump called NATO "obsolete" and threatened to renege
on U.S. treaty obligations argued that the U.S. should not counteract Russia's attempts to be a
global power, supported Great Britain's exit from the European Union, while noting that it would
"probably" benefit Putin,30 and opposed U.S. sanctions for Russia's annexation of Crimea, saying
The people of Crimea, from what I've heard would rather be with Russia than where they were."31
61. Thus, the Trump Campaign, Trump Associates, and Russia shared the common
purpose of undermining Secretary Clinton's candidacy, undermining the DNC and the Democratic
Party, and promoting Trump, whose presidency was expected to benefit Russia's political and
financial interests, and in turn, benefit Trump's financial interests.
62.
Assange and WikiLeaks also shared a common purpose in undermining Secretary
Clinton's candidacy and promoting Trump. Assange had a long of history conflicts with Secretary
Clinton, and Assange publicly stated that his policy disagreements with Clinton would make her
presidency far more problematic than a Trump presidency

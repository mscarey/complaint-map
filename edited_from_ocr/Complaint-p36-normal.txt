Trump-and Russia-Win.
131 On November 8, 2016, Trump won the election to become President of the United
States.
132.
In Moscow, the reaction was jubilation. When the news of Trump's victory broke
in the Duma (Russia's parliament), legislators burst into applause, and the announcement by
Vyacheslav Nikonov, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, was almost drowned out by
clapping and cheering.106 Nikonov stated: "Three minutes ago, Hillary Clinton acknowledged her
defeat in the US presidential elections and just seconds ago, Trump began his speech as president
elect. I congratulate you all on this."07 Defendants' common goal had been achieved.
IV. DEFENDANTS' REPEATED EFFORTS TO COVER UP CONTACTS WITH
RUSSIANS EVIDENCE THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS OF GUILT
133.
Trump's advisers repeatedly denied that members of the Trump Campaign had
contacts with Russians or Russian officials, and when confronted with evidence to the contrary
issued false and misleading statements about the nature of these contacts. For example
(a)
On July 24, 2016, Trump, Jr. was asked about suggestions that the July 22, 2016
release of stolen DNC emails was part of a Russian plot to "help Donald Trump
and hurt Hillary Clinton." Despite having been informed via email weeks earlier
that there was such a plot, Trump, Jr. responded: "Well, just goes to show you
their exact moral compass. They'll say anything to be able to win this. This is
time and time again, lie after lie..It's disgusting, it's so phony
(b)
On July 24, 2016, just weeks after he participated in the June 2016 meeting, Paul
Manafort was asked whether there were any "ties between Mr. Trump, you and
your campaign and Putin and his regime." Manafort replied: "No, there are
not. That's absurd. And, you know, there's no basis to it."
(c)
On November 11, 2016, Trump campaign spokesperson Hope Hicks provided
the Associated Press with a statement denying that the Trump campaign had any
communications with any "foreign entity" during the campaign: "Never
happened. There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign
entity during the campaign."

III THE CONSPIRACY TO DISSEMINATE STOLEN DNC DATA TO AID TRUMP
63. In a January 2017 report (The IC Report"), the U.S. intelligence community
concluded: "Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the
US presidential election, the consistent goals of which were to undermine public faith in the US
democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential
presidency."33 Further, the IC Report concluded: "In July 2015, Russian intelligence gained access
to Democratic National Committee (DNC) networks and maintained that access until at least June
2016", that "by May, the GRU had exfiltrated large volumes of data from the DNC", and that the
"GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks.
64 This operation to infiltrate the DNC servers and disseminate stolen DNC material
was carried out in the United States: Russian operatives trespassed onto computer servers located
in Virginia and Washington, D.C. and stole information located on those servers. It was also
carried out in concert with Assange and WikiLeaks, and with the active support and approval of
the Trump Campaign and the Trump Associates.
65.
The conspirators worked in tandem to accomplish their goal. Russia's intelligence
services illegally hacked into the DNC's computer systems and email accounts in order to steal
and publish trade secrets, including confidential, proprietary documents related to campaigns,
fundraising, and campaign strategy. Russian intelligence services then disseminated the stolen,
confidential materials through GRU Operative #1, as well as WikiLeaks and Assange, who were
actively supported by the Trump Campaign and Trump Associates as they released and disclosed
the information to the American public at a time and in a manner that served their common goals.
The disclosures to the American electorate were undertaken with the purpose and had the effect of
creating dissention within the Democratic party, directing media coverage away from stories
critical of Trump, and generally promoting Trump's presidential candidacy

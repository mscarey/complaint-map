On December 18, 2016, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway was asked
whether anyone involved in the Trump campaign had "any contact with Russians
trying to meddle with the election?" Conway responded: "Absolutely not. And I
discussed that with the president-elect just last night. Those conversations never
happened. I hear people saying it like it's a fact on television. That is just not only
inaccurate and false, but it's dangerous."

In March 2017, Trump, Jr. falsely stated: "Did I meet with people that were
Russian? I'm sure, I'm sure I did. But none that were set up. None that I can think
of at the moment. And certainly none that I was representing the campaign in any
way, shape or form."
() On July 8, 2017, Trump, Jr. released a highly misleading statement about the June
2016 meeting that was reportedly crafted by his father: "It was a short
introductory meeting. I asked Jared [Kushner] and Paul [Manafort] to stop by. We
primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was
active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the
Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no
follow up...
On July 9, 2017, Trump, Jr. released another highly misleading statement about
the June 2016 meeting that continued to omit that he had been told that the
Russian government itself was seeking to help his father: "The woman stated that
she had information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the
Democratic National Committee and supporting Mrs. Clinton. Her statements
were vague, ambiguous and made no sense. No details or supporting information
was provided or even offered. It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful
information. She then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of
Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act. It became clear to me that
this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful
information were a pretext for the meeting."

On October 5, 2017, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying about his contacts with
Mifsud and other Russian contacts during interviews with the FBI. Papadopoulos
also deleted his Facebook account, scrubbed other social media accounts, and
changed his cell phone number in an attempt to hide those contacts.
134. The Russian government has also repeatedly denied responsibility for interference
in the 2016 election, including the cyberattacks on the DNC. Likewise, WikiLeaks and Assange
have repeatedly denied that the stolen DNC material they disseminated was provided to them by
Russia, and have cast doubt on whether Russia was responsible for the cyberattacks on the DNC.

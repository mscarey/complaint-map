emails.
F. The DNC Discovers the Hack and Hires CrowdStrike
82.
On April 28, 2016, DNC IT staff detected and ultimately confirmed access to the
DNC network by unauthorized users.

Upon discovering the intrusion, the DNC contacted CrowdStrike Services, Inc.
("CrowdStrike"), a cybersecurity technology firm, to investigate the attack, assess the damage
done to the DNC's computers and servers, and assist the DNC in its remediation efforts.
84.
CrowdStrike performed forensic analysis on the DNC's computer network and
servers. CrowdStrike also set up a system for monitoring the ongoing attack on Plaintiffs
computer system and to alert the DNC to future attacks.

As a result of the persistence of the Russian state-sponsored infiltration, in order to
remove the unauthorized users from its network, the DNC was required to decommission more
than 140 servers, remove and reinstall all software, including the operating systems, for more than
180 computers, and rebuild at least 11 servers.

G. Forensic Evidence Confirms Russia's Attack on the DNC's Network
86. Both CrowdStrike's forensic analysis and the U.S. Government concluded that the
DNC's computer systems had been hacked by two independent, sophisticated Russian state
sponsored adversaries, both with a nexus to Russia's intelligence services.5 The forensic analysts
tracked the hacking activities of these adversaries by assigning them code names: "Cozy Bear"
and "Fancy Bear," which correspond to the more widely used names Advanced Persistent Threat
29 (APT 29) and Advanced Persistent Threat 28 (APT 28), respectively.6The IC Report
concluded that "Fancy Bear" was acting as an agent of the GRU
87.
Forensic analysis found evidence that Cozy Bear had infiltrated and remained
present in the DNC's network since at least July 27, 2015. The IC Report similarly concluded that
the Russian intelligence first gained access to the DNC network in July 2015. CrowdStrike also
determined that Cozy Bear used the stolen credentials of user accounts to access the DNC's
computer systems.
88.
CrowdStrike determined that the objective of the Cozy Bear actor was to access
and collect information from DNC systems that were primarily used for communications. The
analysis identified Cozy Bear malware in DNC systems providing email, email support, backup
servers, voiceover internet protocol, and chat.
89. The U.S. Government concluded that Cozy Bear was an operative of or associated
with Russian intelligence.57
0 The DNC first detected the infiltration of the GRU, or "Fancy Bear," in its network
on April 28, 2016.
91.
CrowdStrike determined that the GRU's objective was to collect information about
the DNC's political and research activities.

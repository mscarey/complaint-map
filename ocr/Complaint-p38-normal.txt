V. THE SIGNIFICANT HARM INFLICTED UPON PLAINTIFF
135.
The illegal conspiracy inflicted profound damage upon the DNC. The timing and
selective release of the stolen materials prevented the DNC from communicating with the
American electorate on its own terms. These selective releases of stolen material reach a pealk
immediately before the Democratic National Convention and continued through the general
election.
136.
The timing and selective release of stolen materials was designed to and had the
effect of driving a wedge between the DNC and Democratic voters. The release of stolen materials
also impaired the DNC's ability to support Democratic candidates in the general election.
137. The public release of stolen DNC materials was enormously disruptive to the
convention, undermining the party's ability to achieve unity and rally members around their shared
values. The release cast a cloud over the convention's activities, interfering with the party's
opportunity to communicate its vision to the electorate.
138.
The release of this stolen material upended the DNC's ability to communicate
effectively among staff and with members of the party and broader community. It also exposed
the DNC's staff to constant threats by telephone and email, which were unavoidable because staff
could not change their contact information with the convention underway.
139.
The DNC also suffered significant interruption and disruption of its political and
fundraising activities throughout the United States during the critical final months of the
presidential campaign. Specifically, the release of personal, and sometimes embarrassing,
information about DNC donors had a chilling effect on donations to the DNC, resulting ina
substantial loss of income to the DNC and a reduction in the overall amounts of funds that the
DNC could expend to support Democratic candidates nationwide.

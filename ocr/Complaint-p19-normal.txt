THE COMMON PURPOSE: BOLSTER TRUMP AND DENIGRATE THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY NOMINEE
55.
The common purpose of the conspiracy among Russia and the Trump Associates
was to bolster Trump's campaign for president, to injure the DNC, and to harm the Democratic
party's chances for success in the 2016 presidential election. This common purpose sprang from
multiple, well-documented motives.
56.
In December 2011, massive protests broke out in Russia in response to allegations
of vote rigging and election fraud in the Russian parliamentary elections. Thousands of Russians
took to the streets to protest the victory of then-Prime Minister Putin's political party, in one of
Russia's largest protests since the fall of the U.S.S.R.22
57.
Concerned about maintaining power and exerting control, Putin lashed out, blaming
the protests on then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Putin asserted that Secretary Clinton had
"set the tone for some of our actors in the country and gave the signal." And he accused her of
ordering the opposition movement into action: "They heard this and, with the support of the U.S
State Department, began active work."2
58.
At the same time, Trump left no doubt as to his views on Russia. Prior to the 2016
campaign, he spent nearly a decade espousing pro-Russian and pro-Putin views, praising Putin as
"doing a great job in rebuilding the image of Russia" (2007),24 stating that he "really likeld
Vladimir Putin [and] respect[ed] him. He does his work well. Much better than our Bush" (2008)
and characterizing Putin's illegal annexation of Crimea as "so smart . . . And he [Putin] really
goes step by step by step, and you have to give him a lot of credit" (2014)
